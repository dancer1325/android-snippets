# Android Snippets
* code snippets / used | Android documentation on [developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com/guide).

The idea is that by having a small sample project that contains the code snippets from documentation, developers will gain more context on how to implement a specific API.

In addition, by having CI running on this repo, we can ensure that the code snippets on developer.android.com is in a working condition.
